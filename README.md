## Description
From what I've seen from publicly released chat color plugins is that they can only be defined via a config file which to me isn't very user friendly and does not let players change their stuff on the fly. So I decided to make a custom chat plugin based off of an old community I used to play on where the players can set their chat tag(with colors), name color and chat color by commands and menus.

## Commands

* sm_colors - Used to display the chat color menu
* sm_namecolors - Used to display the name colors menu
* sm_settag - Used to set a cusutom chat tag or print out the list of colors useable
